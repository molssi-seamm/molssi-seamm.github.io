Flowchart Interpreter

The flowchart interpreter is an important part of the SEAMM infrastructure
that reads the instructions and protocols pertinent to a specific workflow
from a flowchart and turns them into instructions digestible for the computer.
The users do not interact with the flowchart interpreter directly.
