Creating a New Plug-in
**********************
Creating, testing, documenting, and releasing a plug-in involves many steps. This
section will walk you through each of the steps, giving enough detail to be
successful. Don't worry! While it may look daunting at first, creating a plug-in is not
that difficult but it is a bit confusing and tedious. The steps are as follows:

   #. :ref:`Creating the skeleton and creating a GitHub repository for it. <creating>`
   #. Editing the control parameters.
   #. Customizing the GUI, if needed.
   #. Adding the logic to actually do the work for the step.

      * Describing the results of the calculation.
      * :ref:`Defining any properties to be saved in the database. <properties>`

   #. Documentation.
   #. Releasing the plug-in.
