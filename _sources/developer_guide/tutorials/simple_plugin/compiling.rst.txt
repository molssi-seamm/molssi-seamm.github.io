"Compiling" the plug-in
***********************

We'll get to looking at the code in a minute, but first let's try "compiling" the
plug-in -- yes, it is Python, so not compiled, but the cookiecutter provides tools for
checking the Python to make sure it compliant with PEP-8, installing the package, and
then testing the module. There is a Makefile at the top level of the directory that was
just created so you don't have to remember the details of the commands. You need to `cd`
to the directory and run `make lint install test`::

  (seamm-dev) psaxe@PaulsPersonal SEAMM % cd pyscf_step
  cd pyscf_step
  (seamm-dev) psaxe@PaulsPersonal pyscf_step % make lint install test
  make lint install test
  black --extend-exclude '_version.py' --check --diff pyscf_step tests

**black** is complaining about some of the formatting. The cookiecutter prepares
reasonably formatted code, but since it doesn't know how long the name of the package
and classes, it may not get it right. "PySCF" is quite short, so a couple of the
arguments for methods could be written on one line, rather than several, and black,
being picky wants you to change the code. Of course there is a make target to do this!
`make format`::

  (seamm-dev) psaxe@PaulsPersonal pyscf_step % make format
  make format
  black --extend-exclude '_version.py' pyscf_step tests
  reformatted pyscf_step/pyscf_parameters.py
  reformatted pyscf_step/pyscf.py

  All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
  2 files reformatted, 5 files left unchanged.

.. attention::
   You may not be in the habit of using **black** and **flake8**, but we strongly
   recommend that you use the Makefile in SEAMM projects and use `make lint install
   test` religously as you develop. At first you may have a lot of format issues, but
   will quickly learn (be trained?) to write clean code in the style used in all SEAMM
   modules. In a large project such as SEAMM it is important that the code be similar
   throughout. We have set up the environment for **black** and **flake8** to ensure
   consistency and a standard style for SEAMM. So please use the Makefile!

Now that the code is properly formatted, we can run `make lint install test` again::

  (seamm-dev) psaxe@PaulsPersonal pyscf_step % make lint install test
  make lint install test
  black --extend-exclude '_version.py' --check --diff pyscf_step tests
  All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®

That worked! It installed and tested your new skeleton plug-in. Later you will have a
chance to look at the tests, and add to the one very simple test that was created
automatically, but for now ... success!

So, what just happened? Let's start SEAMM and find out.

   The initial PySCF plug-in in SEAMM

PySCF appears under the simulations in the left pane, clicking on adds a PySCF step to
the flowchart, and double-clicking on the step opens a dialog for editing the options
for the step. In otherwords, we have a complete, functioning plug-in but of course it
doesn't know anything about PySCF. That's your job now: educate the plug-in about PySCF.
