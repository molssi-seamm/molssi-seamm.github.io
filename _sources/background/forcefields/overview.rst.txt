Overview of Forcefields
***********************

What is a forcefield? And what do all these terms, parameters, etc. actually mean?
Unfortunately while there are many papers on forcefields and descriptions of what a
forcefield is, many of them are quite specific and limited to the context at hand. The
words used to describe forcefields, the terms in a forcefield, and how a forcefield is
used -- the jargon -- is not consistent, particularly between subfields, and is very
confusing.

While this document can't solve all of these problems, it will lay out a general and
simple description of forcefields and define the terminology used in SEAMM. It will also
try to note some of the other terminology used by other groups and subfields. Hopefully
this will help you more fully understand forcefield and be able to read the rest of the
documentation about forcefields in SEAMM without being confused by the concepts and
terminology.

We'll use a specific example -- `OPLS
<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00334a030>`_ -- to illustrate a forcefield. OPLS
is one of the earlier forcefields, so the description in the paper is reasonably
complete. If you look at later papers, they tend to assume that you know the jargon that
was introduced by various papers since the field was invented, which is a bit awkard if
you don't know the field, or if you come from a different field with different jargon!
