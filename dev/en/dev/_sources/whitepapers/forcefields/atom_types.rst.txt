Atom Types
**********

One area not mentioned in our example `OPLS paper
<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00334a030>`_ is how to get the right parameters in
each of the terms in the functional form. We glossed over this in the description of
the section on the :doc:`functional_form`, noting that we had various sets of parameters
for the Lennard-Jones potential and for the torsions but not going deeper. If you read
the paper you will notice that they use specific molecules and functional groups in the
description of the parameters. In Table III the Lennard-Jones are described by the type
of carbon atom and an example:

The torsion parameters just use an example:

Presumably when this paper was written and computers were much smaller, the simulations
were smaller and simpler so it was not an issue to set them up by hand, matching the
atoms in the molecules to the descriptions in the paper. However as the systems became
larger and more complicated, many of the forcefields for organic and biomolecules
migrated to a more formal concept of "atom types". The concept is simple: every atom has
a local environment, which to a first approximation is defined by the nearby atoms and
the bonding. If the atoms have identical environments, then they are the same "type". If
the environments are different but quite similar then the forcefield developer may lump
them together in a single type, though what is similar is a matter of opinion, so
different forcefields and even different versions of a forcefield may group atoms
together in different way.

Working through an example using OPLS might help make this more clear.

isopentane
----------

.. figure:: /images/isopentane.png

   :alt: isopentane

   Figure 3: isopentane with the atoms numbered.

The structure for isopentane has four different atom environments. Atoms 1 & 2 are
topologically identical. The other methyl group, atom 5, is quite similar but not quite
the same. The remaining two atoms, 3 and 4, are a >CH- and -CH2- group repectively.

Now the task is to decide which Lennard-Jones and torsional parameters are appropriate
for this molecule. Starting with the Lennard-Jones parameters first, let's examine the
three methyl groups. OPLS has parameters for 12 different types of carbon groups:

1. CH4 as in methane
2. CH3 (C1) as in ethane
3. CH3 (C2) as in n-butane
4. CH3 (C3) as in isobutane
5. CH3 (C4) as in neopentane
6. CH2 (sp3) as in n-butane
7. CH2 (sp2) as in 1-butene
8. CH (sp3) as in isobutane
9. CH (sp2) as in 2-butene
10. CH (arom) as in benzene
11. C (sp3) as in neopentane
12. C (sp2) as in isobutene

The two identical methyl groups, 1 & 2, are similar to the methyl groups in isobutane in
that they are bonded to a tertiary carbon, so 4: CH3 (C3) is a reasonable choice for them. The
other methyl group, 5, is probably closer to those in n-butane since it is bonded to
a -CH2- group. Thus 3: CH3 - (C2) is probably the best choice.

Moving on to atom 4, the -CH2- group, there is only one possibility, 6: CH2 (sp3) as in
n-butane. It seems to be a reasonable choice.

Finally, atom 3, the >CH- group, again has only one possibility, 8: CH (sp3) as in
isobutane, and again this seems like a reasonable choice.

We can sum this up with the following picture, showing isopentane labeled by the atom
types 1-12:

   :alt: isopentane atom types

   Figure 4: isopentane showing the atom types

Now for the torsion types. There is only one "rotatable" bond in neopentane, that
between atoms 3 and 4 in Figure 1, meaning that the angle between the planes defined by
atom 2-3-4 and 3-4-5 changes the structure in a meaninful way. Not coincidentally of the
three specific sets of torsional parameters in Table II above, one is noted as for
neopentane so is clearly the one to use. Looking at the atom types in Figure 2, we could
write this torsion as having the following atom types:

   CH3(C3) - CH(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH3(C2)

Expressing Torsions in Terms of Atom Types
------------------------------------------

Let's express the structures for the different torsions in Table II as atom types an see
what it looks like.

1-butene
++++++++

.. figure:: /images/1-butene_atom_types.png
   :width: 300px
   :align: center
   :alt: 1-butene atom types

   Figure 5: 1-butene showing the atom types

The atom types labeling the atoms are reasonable given the information in Table 3. The
torsion is labeled as follows:

    CH2(sp2) - CH(sp2) - CH2(sp3) - CH3(C2)

n-butane
++++++++

.. figure:: /images/n-butane_atom_types.png
   :width: 300px
   :align: center
   :alt: n-butane atom types

   Figure 6: n-butane showing the atom types

The torsion is labeled as follows:

    CH3(C2) - CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH3(C2)

n-pentane
+++++++++

.. figure:: /images/n-pentane_atom_types.png
   :width: 300px
   :align: center
   :alt: n-pentane atom types

   Figure 7: n-pentane showing the atom types

The torsion is labeled as follows:

    CH3(C2) - CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3)

There is a second torsion in this molecule, starting one atom into the chain:

    CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH3(c2)

Note however that this is the same as the first torsion except with the atoms ordered in
the reverse direction. Which direction you look down the rotating bond makes no
difference, so these two are identical.

For longer normal alkanes this torsion would appear at both ends. In the middle of the
chains, all four atoms involved in the torsion would be -CH2- groups:

    CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3) - CH2(sp3)
    
In Table II the last torsion is labeled as for all other n-alkanes, so in OPLS both of
these torsions, which are just slightly different, are treated identically.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

We have seen how atoms in similar environments can be grouped into atom types. This
allows us to recast the OPLS forcefield in terms of atom types, and associate the
parameters in terms of atom types.

The following table expands their Table III giving a picture defining the atom type. Red
indicates the atom whose type is described, with the picture giving a substructure,
meaning that terminal atoms may be part of a longer chain or have other substituents
unle a full valence is indicated explicitly.

Automatic Assignment
--------------------

As computers have gotten more and more powerful the complexity of simulations has grown
by leaps and bounds. It is no longer viable to assign the atom types to the structure by
hand, nor would that lead to reproducible simulations since there is often a choice of
similar parameters, so different people will choose different options.

There are two approaches in general use for automatically assigning the atom types and
hence the parameters for a simulation. Perhaps the initial approach was to use template
or residue libraries, relying on the regular structure and naming of proteins. A later
paper of the extension of `OPLS for proteins
<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00214a001>`_ illustrates the approach:

.. figure:: /images/OPLS-9.png
   :width: 500px
   :align: center
   :alt: Atom type assignment for proteins

   Figure 8: Atom type assignment for proteins in OPLS.

This table gives the residue, standard atom name, and atom type for the standard amino
acids. OPLS has migrated to using numbers for the atom types, compared to the more
descriptive text used in the original paper. CH3(C2) has become atom type 10 and
CH2(sp3), 9. The nonbond parameters remain unchanged from the original paper, just the
name has changed.

The template approach is certainly simple, and has been and still is widely used for
biomolecules -- peptides, proteins, DNA and lipids -- where there are strong naming
conventions for the atomms.

However, for more general organic chemistry templates are not useful since there is no
standard naming conventions for the atom. This gave rise to the second approach, some
form of chemical perception. With some thought and effort, it is possible to translate
the pictures above into e.g. `SMARTS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILES_arbitrary_target_specification>`_ for substructure
searches for the atom type assignment. This approach was certainly implemented for the
CVFF and CFF series of forcefields at Biosym in the early 1990's, and with the
widespread adoption of SMARTS and similar tools for substructure matching is becoming
more feasible and widespread.

Summary
-------

Atom types provide an approach for collecting atoms in simlar local environments into
groups, and specifying which parameters to use for the terms in a forcefield. Typical
valence forcefields have terms relying on one, two, three and four atoms -- the nonbonded
terms, bonds, angles, and torsions and out-of-plane terms, respectively. For a given
molecule or system the atom types are assigned, either by hand, using template
libraries, or by chemical perception. Once the atom types are assigned to the structure
finding the correct parameters for each term is reduced to a lookup in tables indexed by
the atom types.
