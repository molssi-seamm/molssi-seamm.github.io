Getting Started
***************

This part of the documentation focusses on getting you up and running quickly. The first
section is a quickstart to installing SEAMM, followed by tutorials that show you how to
do straightforward tasks in SEAMM. These focus on the mechanics of working with SEAMM so
use relatively simple problems. For more serious tasks look to the :ref:`How-Tos <how-tos>`

.. attention::
   Currently, SEAMM is in the early stages of its deployment and beta testing by the
   members of the computational molecular sciences community.  Although we have made
   every efforts to minimize errors and glitches in the SEAMM software infrastructure,
   similar to any open-source software project it its early days, there may be bugs and
   issues we haven't seen. If you find something or have a suggestion, please let us
   know!
   
   There is a `forum <https://matsci.org/c/seamm/61>`_ for reporting problems and sharing
   ideas and experiences. Thanks to the wonderful people at
   `matsci.org <https://matsci.org>`_ for providing the infrastructure and management for
   so many useful forums! You can also email us at seamm@molssi.org or join the `Slack
   channel
   <https://join.slack.com/t/seamm/shared_invite/zt-gd85l7k4-~r9xCoRSCfFHrAHnG7duFA>`_.

   SEAMM is fully open-source allowing anyone to contribute to its growth by opening
   issues, forking the repository and submitting pull requests in order to make changes
   in the code or documentation. SEAMM is also a large-scale and ambitious project with
   many moving parts. Thus, it will take some time to become truly stable! We appreciate
   your patience and assistance throughout the development process!

The following sections -- which are also in the menu to the left -- will get you
started:
