Job Manager
***********

The Job Manager is another part of SEAMM infrastructure that the users
do not interact with directly. Nonetheless, the :term:`dashboard`
allows the users to monitor the running :term:`jobs<job>` which are
managed by the Job Manager. The Job Manager and the Dashboard simplify
the task of managing the jobs, submitting the :term:`tasks<task>` to
queues, and fetching the results back.
