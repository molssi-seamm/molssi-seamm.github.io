This section presents tutorials to help you get started with SEAMM and explore its
capabilities. You should have installed SEAMM and added passwords to the Dashboard
before starting these tutorials.

You need to go through at least the first two to get started. They cover creating a
flowchart in the SEAMM GUI and submitting it as a job, and then examining the results in
the Dashboard. To get the most from SEAMM go through the rest of the tutorials, which
show how to use variables, loops, and tables to automate routine tasks with SEAMM.

After finishing the tutorials look at the :ref:`user-guide` for more information about
using SEAMM, and also the specific :ref:`plug-ins` and their User Guides.
